# Supplier Selection — a simple multi-agent system

A factory needs to buy a component. Two agents and one tool work together to
compare the available suppliers and recommend one.

```
Factory user
  → Buyer Agent                       identifies the criteria, coordinates the work
      → Supplier Analysis Agent       compares the options, recommends one
          → Supplier Information Tool the only source of supplier data
  ← Buyer Agent                       final answer back to the user
```

Everything runs locally: a small LLM in Ollama, plain Python tools, Docker.
No web search, no RAG, no MCP, no external API keys.

## Run it

Docker Desktop must be running first.

```
cd psgv-sweng889/week4/2-supplier-agents
docker compose up -d ollama
docker compose run --rm agent-app
```

The first run downloads the model, which takes a few minutes. After that it
starts in a few seconds.

You will see a menu:

```
  1. Run the default factory request
  2. Enter your own factory request
  3. Show the supplier catalogue (tool output only)
  q. Quit
```

Option 1 runs this request:

> The factory needs 400 units within 7 days. Recommend the best supplier and
> explain the decision.

When you are done:

```
docker compose down
```

### Changing the model

The model is set in `docker-compose.yml`:

```
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:1.5b
```

Any Ollama-compatible model works — `llama3.2:1b`, `gemma3:1b`, `phi3:mini`.
After changing it, run `docker compose up -d ollama` and then
`docker compose run --rm agent-app` again.

The application never hardcodes the model or its address. Both arrive as
environment variables, so the same code runs against a different model, or a
model on a different machine, without any edit.

The console prints a banner at each stage. The sequence of banners in one run
is a trace of the interaction between the user, the two agents, and the tool —
useful evidence when you draw your UML sequence diagram.

## The starter system is deliberately incomplete

It runs end to end, but it does not reason well yet.

**Record the baseline before you change anything.** Use option 1 to confirm the
system works, then use option 2 to run the two factory requests listed in
Task 1 of the assignment and save the output. You compare against it in Task 4.

Four gaps are marked with `TODO` comments in the code. Each comment explains
what is missing and why it matters.

| | Where | What is missing | Changes the decision? |
|---|---|---|---|
| TODO 1 | `agents/buyer_agent.py` — criteria prompt | Asks for a loose summary, so the next agent has to guess the quantity and the deadline. | Sometimes |
| TODO 2 | `agents/supplier_analysis_agent.py` — analysis prompt | Only says "recommend one supplier". Never names the attributes that matter, or says that quantity and deadline are hard limits. | **Yes** |
| TODO 3 | `agents/buyer_agent.py` — `check_risks()` | Returns nothing, so an impossible recommendation reaches the user unchallenged. | **Yes** |
| TODO 4 | `agents/buyer_agent.py` — `format_response()` | Passes the model's raw text straight through to the user. | No |

Task 3 of the assignment asks for a change that alters what the system
**decides, recommends, or warns about**. TODO 2 and TODO 3 do that on their
own. TODO 1 and TODO 4 improve the system but usually leave the recommendation
unchanged, so combine them with one of the other two.

`find_supplier()` in `tools/supplier_tool.py` returns the structured record for
whichever supplier the agent named, which is what TODO 3 needs.

## Things worth noticing when you run it

Small models are not careful readers. Look for these in your output, because
they are what your reflection is about:

* Does the recommendation satisfy **both** the quantity and the deadline in the
  request? Check it against the catalogue yourself.
* Does an agent ever mention a supplier the tool did not return, or a price or
  delivery time that does not match the data?
* Run the same request two or three times. How much does the answer change?

The answer is not stable across runs or across models. That is a property of
the system you are studying, not a bug in the starter code — and it is worth a
sentence in your reflection.

## Troubleshooting

**My code changes do not seem to take effect.**
They should. The project folder is mounted into the container, so editing a
file and re-running `docker compose run --rm agent-app` picks up the change
immediately — no rebuild needed. If nothing changes, check that you saved the
file and that you edited the copy inside `2-supplier-agents/`.

**Docker says a container name is already in use, or a port is allocated.**
A container from another exercise is still running. Find it with `docker ps`,
then stop it with `docker rm -f <name>`, or run `docker compose down` in that
folder.

**It seems to hang after I choose an option.**
The model is thinking. A small model on CPU takes ten to thirty seconds per
agent, and each run calls the model twice.

**It cannot reach Ollama.**
Run `docker compose up -d ollama` first and give it a moment to start, then try
again.
